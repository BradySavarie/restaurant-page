<i>This website is a simple digital storefront for a mock health foods company that features a tabbed-browsing navigation system. The design was crafted using Tailwind, and each page has been developed as a Javascript module that is bundled using Webpack.</i>

This application is a part of The Odin Projects Full-Stack Javascript curriculum and was developed with the purpose of integrating Webpack and ES6 modules into my workflow. I decided to use Tailwind for styling so I could get comfortable working with more complicated project configurations.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

This project taught me alot about the benefits of using modules. Splitting my code up into more managable chunks and then bundling them together really helps with maintainability. I found it alot easier to navigate through my repository and find the lines of code that I need to make changes to. Configuring Webpack to work with Tailwind was quite a challenge as well and it really helped me understand how to manage bundled assets and use loaders properly which I think will prove to be important in future projects.
