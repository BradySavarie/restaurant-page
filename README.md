<i>This website is a simple digital storefront for a mock health foods company that features a tabbed-browsing navigation system. The design was crafted using Tailwind, and each page has been developed as a Javascript module that is bundled using Webpack.</i>

This application is a part of The Odin Projects Full-Stack Javascript curriculum and was developed with the purpose of integrating Webpack and ES6 modules into my workflow. I decided to use Tailwind for styling so I could get comfortable working with more complicated project configurations.
